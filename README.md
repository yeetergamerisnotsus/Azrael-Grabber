# Azrael-Grabber

Azrael Grabber is an amazing token logger that bypasses most antiviruses and auto-detects if a sandbox or VM is being used.
Azrael Grabber is one of the best grabbers on github and beats and skid's one. Our team has done extensive research and found how to 
exploit the terminal and turns off the victim's antvirus so quickly they wont be able to know what happened.
